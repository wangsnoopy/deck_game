# Here is the description of the game simulation.

# this is a two player card game
# the game starts with a deck of cards
# the cards are dealt out to both players
# on each turn:
# both players turn over their top-most card
# the player with the higher valued card takes the cards and puts them in their scoring pile (scoring 1 point per card)
# this continues until the players have no cards left
# the player with the highest score wins
# It’s considered a simulation because the players don’t have any choice, dont worry about input
